# Description of Methods

## Latent Representations Visualization
Latent representations visualization is suggested for better understanding of intra-layer manifold transformations by the neural network.

Visualization is performed on the data, provided by the user. The method takes representations on some layers (specified by the user). Those representations are projected onto 2d space with a dimensionality reduction technique (either UMAP [1] or PCA [2]).
